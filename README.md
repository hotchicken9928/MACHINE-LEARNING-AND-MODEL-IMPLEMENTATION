## This project shows the basic implementation of machine learning model which functions to classify inbox email as either spams or non-spams, this model incorporates data loading, text preprocessing and evaluates that available date using prominent python libraraies like the numpy, jupyter, matplotlib, etc (which are mentioned in the requirements.txt file) . This model categorizes mails as 'spam' or 'ham' with using the technique of converting raw email texts into numerical features that are suitable for machine learning. The numerical computing part is done with the help of numpy and scipy libraries and then using the numerical date to build the modle using the scikit-learn and the whole code and the execution part is set in the jupyter notebook environment, this is where the development will take place and finally the model will determine the mails as the spam or ham while displaying the output in graphical manner which will be generated with the help of the libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
